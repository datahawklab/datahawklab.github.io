## Openshift on your Windows 10 pro machine

Make sure your machine is multi core and has at last 16gb of ram.
Windows 10 PRO is a requirement.

### Prepare your machine

Prepare your laptop/desktop for Openshift.

* Connect to an Ethernet connection and disable your wireless network card
see ***Disable wireless network adapter*** below

* Turn on Hypervisor
  * control panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows features on or off
  * Enable all Hyper-v options.

* Add your id to the HyperVisor Admnistrators Group via PowerShell
  * run powershell as admninistrator

  * Via Powershell add yourself to the Hyperv administrators group:

     ```powershell
     ([adsi]"WinNT://./Hyper-V Administrators,group").Add("WinNT://$env:UserDomain/$env:Username,user")
     ```

### Get Codeready containers and pull secret
***This requies a free Redhat account, signup for one if you dont already have one.
*** Make sure you copy the pull secret as well.

### Set a local path to the location of crc.exe

![set local path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10190444/65509159-d23ead00-de9f-11e9-924e-0387be562ac3.png)

### Start Openshift

open a cmd prompt and setup your environment

```bash
crc setup
```

Start Openshift

```bash
crc start
#paste the pull secret when requested
```

Note your login info:

```bash
INFO To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions
INFO Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'
INFO To login as an admin, username is 'kubeadmin' and password is BMLkR-NjA28-v7exC-8bwAk
INFO
INFO These credentials can also be used to access the OpenShift web console at https://console-openshift-console.apps-cr
c.testing
```

### Go to the Openshift console

[https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing](https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing)

### Use the Openshift OC command line interface

* In a cmd prompt set your environment

```powershell
crc oc-env
```

* Run the command on the last line

```
@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('crc oc-env') DO @call %i
```

* login to Openshift with the default developer id and password

```powershell
oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

### Login as Kubeadmin

* find your openshift kubeadmin password
In a cmd prompt run:

```bat
type %userprofile%\.crc\cache\crc_hyperv_4.1.14\kubeadmin-password
```

* Login as kubeadmin to Openshfit
Set your env as noted above if you havent done so already.
use the password as noted above

```powershell
oc login -u kubeadmin -p BMLkR-NjA28-v7exC-8bwAk https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

In Windows explorer navigate to %

# See below if you get any errors

### Disable wireless network adapter

I have had issues where the Hyper-v virtual switch doesnt work if it uses the wirless adapter for the virtual ethernet card.
I have had to disable the wireless adapter so that Hyper-v chooses the Ethernet adapter for Default Switch.

* Go to Control Panel --> Network and Internet --> Network Connections

* Open the Hyper-v manager and verify that the Default switch is using the Ethernet adapter

### Fix windows 10 Pro bug if you get an error on crc start

This is related to a bug with how Hyper-v on windows handles DHCP for virtual machines.

```bash
ERRO Error occurred: Error approving the node csr Not able to get csr names (exit status 1 : Unable to connect to the se
rver: dial tcp 172.18.7.77:6443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly res
pond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
```  

* Open a Powershell cmd prompt with admin priviliges

* Get the IP address of your Openshift Hyper-v VM
```get-vm -Name crc | Select -ExpandProperty Networkadapters```

* Open Notepad with admin priviliges

* Open the hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc with ip address entries for your Openshift VM

```bash
# replace you VM ip address with the address below and save the file
172.18.7.77  api.crc.testing
172.18.7.77  oauth-openshift.apps-crc.testing
172.18.7.77  console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing
```

* Start Codeready containers again and navigate to the Openshift web console
```crc start```

2. 16GB of RAM
3. SSD hard drive
4. multi-core processor (8 preferrable but not necessdary)

High Level oveview:

1. Verify your running Windows 10 PRO or Upgrade windows 10 Home to windows 10 PRO:
    * search for `System` and in the search window.
      ![System Information](../img/system-information-search.png)

   ![Windows 10 Pro Verification](../img/windows_10_pro_verification.png)

2. Install and configure HyperV  on Windows 10 Pro
    * Turn on HyperV on Windows 10 Pro
      `control panel --> Programs --> Turn Windows Features on or off`
      ![turn on hyperV](../img/hyperv_features_turn_on.png)

    * add your id to the HyperVisor Admnistrators Group via PowerShell:
        * run powershell as admninistrator
          ![Run Powershell as administrator](../img/powershell-run-as-administrator.png)
        * Via Powershell add yourself to the Hyperv administrators group:

      ```
      ([adsi]”WinNT://./Hyper-V Administrators,group”).Add(“WinNT://$env:UserDomain/$env:Username,user”)
      ```

    * create external virtual switch via HypeVadmin on your Ethernet adapter NOT wireless adapter.
      ***You may have to apply the following fix if the Virtual Switch creation errors out: [Virtual Switch Creation Error fix](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3101106/you-cannot-create-a-hyper-v-virtual-switch-on-64-bit-versions-of-windo)***

      ![HyperV Admin select virtual switch](../img/hypervmanager-select-virtual-switch-manager.png)

      ![HyperV Admin create external switch](../img/hypervmanager-create-external-switch.png)

      ***make sure to add the virtual switch against your Eternet network adapter and not your wifi adapter***
      ![HyperV Admin create external switch ethernet](../hyperv-manager-external-switch-wired-nic.png)

3. Download and start minishift with the following switches
    * from where you downloaded and extract minishift
    * start a powershell command window as administrator
      ![Run Powershell as administrator](../img/powershell-run-as-administrator.png)
    * cd to where you downloaded and extracted minishift

   ```powershell
   c:\usr\minishift\minishift.exe start --hyperv-virtual-switch "minishiftvswitch" --memory 8GB
   ```

output:

```powershell

Base image creation
====================

**Create a build config for  binary docker build**
Creates build config objects. This sets up a docker build in openshift that pushes to artifactory using the openjdk image as a base.
instructions on sourcing the oc binary [oc-binary-source.md](oc-binary-source.md)

```bash
oc new-build --name=base-mule-image-build --binary=true --to=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/base-mule-image:latest --to-docker=true --strategy=docker --image-stream=bac/openjdk18:latest
```

**clone the base build repo**

```bash
git clone ssh://****.git
```

**cd to the cloned project folder and do a docker build and push base image to repo**

```bash
cd $proj_folder
oc start-build base-mule-image-build --from-dir=.
```

App base image layered on binary base image
====================

This sets up a docker build in openshift, which uses the previously created mule base image as the base layer.
It pushes the final image to artifactory
**create App image build config**

```
oc new-build --name=app-mule-image-build --binary=true --to=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/app-mule-image:latest --to-docker=true --strategy=docker --docker-image=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/base-mule-image:latest
```

**Starts the build for the app image.  Run this in the directory with the application docker file and the application jar**

```
oc start-build app-mule-image-build --from-dir=.
```

**Create a build config for  binary docker build**
Creates build config objects. This sets up a docker build in openshift that pushes to artifactory using the openjdk image as a base.
